In this politically turbulant times I think America should work together to find something most people agree with. They all want to say how their Tax Dollar is spent. 

When a person files their taxes every year they now have one Tax Dollar to spend on the US budget. They can split up that dollar any way they want.

Every year the Congressional Budget Office, CBO could compile the data collected and the cenusu beurau would collect the data. Then publish the results at the end on the tax season.  

When People file their taxes the can submit a document the states their belief to how their Tax Dollar is spent by the federal government.  With  Personal Privacy maintained, this data is compiled into a pool and publicly published at the end of the tax season. The People of America  now have a new input mechanism to the government process.   Every year an organized census is taken that reflects the Mood of America. 

The census data is published after every tax season the data is published to the state level,  Now people have a new voice into the government process 

Using control theory to create a system by which to tax payer could suggest how their Tax Dollar is spent in the federal budget. This system would add a new feedback indicator in to the government process. Does not matter what side of the political spectrum the person is on, they the is a voice. Tax are paid every year so people vote every a year. It is a suggestion of what the budget the people would want.  greater government financial responsibility.
